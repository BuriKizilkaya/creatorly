# Architecture

## Overview

Creatorly is a application, which makes the creation of repositories easier. The application reads from a template repository or from a template folder and creates a new repository from it. This repository is transferred to the corresponding Git-Online service (Github, Gitlab or AzureDevops). In addition, the corresponding policies and settings for the repository are set at the Git-Online service.
