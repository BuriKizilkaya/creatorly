=== Exclude text from rendering

If you want to exclude text from rendering, you can use the `{% raw %}blablab{% endraw %}` tag. This is useful for templates that contain a CI pipeline file which has some variables that should not be rendered.

==== Example

[source,yaml]
----

name: Extract version number
id: extract_version
run: echo "{{ creatorly.projectname }}{% raw %}=$(echo ${{ github.ref }} | sed 's/refs\/tags\/V\(.*\)/\1/')" >> $GITHUB_ENV{% endraw %}

----


=== Absolute Path

It's recommend using absolute paths!
